Dear Martha-

I just happened across the Random Hall Homepage and, as a long-ago
Random Hall resident, was swept with a wave of nostalgia. The washing
machine status -- most impressive.

BUT ... I browsed to the Random's Past page and was quite taken aback by
the inaccuracies I found there.  Let me expand a little:

> Random's Past
> 
> History From a Random Alum
> 
> Linus Yamane graduated from MIT in 1981. He was part of the first freshman class to be housed in Random in 1977.

Far from it.
 
> Prior to 1977, Random Hall housed only visiting professors, 

Not even close! 

Random Hall was officially dedicated as an MIT dorm on Leap Year's Day
of 1968. Present at the ceremony, if memory serves me, were then MIT
President Howard Johnson and Dean of Students Ken Wadleigh, together
with a variety of other dignitaries. We chose Leap Year's Day as the
official opening of the dorm so its birthday would fall only once every
4 years, eventually making it the youngest of all of the dorms.  

I forget how many students (all male) lived there at first, but I know
it was full. It had been taken over by MIT to house an overflow of
students needing campus housing. I don't know how long it actually
served as a dorm that first time around, as I graduated in 1969. I
suspect Mr. Yamane is accurate about the housing for visiting faculty
and more recent history of Random Hall, but I do know about the earlier
history -- I lived there in '68 - '69 and I was the founding President
of Random Hall.

I don't remember a whole lot of other details off the top of my head,
but I did want to dash off this note to fill you all in on some
(apparently unknown) Random Hall history.

Regards to all current Random residents.

PS For what it's worth, Random Hall was originally going to be named
"Random House." Dean Wadleigh & I sent a joint letter to Bennett Cerf,
then head of Random House Publishers, inviting him to the dedication
ceremony. We received a "cease & desist" type letter from Random House
legal folks. It became Random Hall, named, of course, in honor and
memory of J. Arthur Random.
