While browsing the web recently I came across the Randon Hall home page

and the history page.  The history seems to be missing a few things

(like the whole first use of the building as a dorm), so I thought I

would send some mail to the person listed as maintainer of the page.



Random Hall was first opened as an MIT dorm in 1968.  It was supposed to

be available at the start of the 1967/68 school year, but there were

construction problems (I seem to remember some sort of strike that

slowed things down) and it just wasn't finished.  Those of us who had

signed up to move to Random were "parked" elsewhere for the fall

semester of 1967.  Many of us shared apartments in Eastgate, which had

just opened.  Others were in a building on West Street.  Unlike the

later reopening which seems to have mostly freshman for residents, we

had a fairly normal mix of people from the then-current classes.  There

was a lot of crowding in the existing dorms at the time, and many of us

were quite willing to take space in a new dorm to keep from being

doubled in rooms designed for one person in the current dorms.  Also,

the kitchens and living rooms on each floor were unique in the dorm

system at the time.



Random actually opened at the beginning of the spring semester in 1968. 

The building was dedicated on February 29, 1968.  We had our one-halfth

birthday party on March 1, 1970.  We planned to call it Random House,

but the publishing company of that name threatened to sue so we settled

for "Random Hall".  The official sweatshirts had the definition of the

word "random" taken (I believe) from the Random House dictionary.  The

first floor of 290 held Russian House.



Based on the picture on the home page, the exterior hasn't changed much,

though mention of an elevator (!) in one of the other Random pages makes

me feel that the inside has changed a lot.



Before MIT converted it to a dorm, the building had been a rooming

house.  In the past, it apparently had a few tenants who were destined

to become famous.  At the dedication party, Louis Smullin (then head of

the EE department if I remember correctly) said that he had lived in the

building while he was a student, and I believe he said Claude Shannon

had lived there as well.
