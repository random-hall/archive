it was wonderful seeing the random hall home page
on the web. i was a freshman in random hall the
very first year it opened up, and graduated from
random hall in 1981. please link my homepage to
the list of random hall alums. since i don't recognize
any of the names on the list, i must be the oldest
alum on the list.

of random hall, just ask.
