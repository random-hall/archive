Subject: Re: random hall home page 

hi melissa,
thanks for linking my homepage to random hall...

before 1977 random hall was apparently a guest house for visiting
professors and scholars. but in 1977 too many of us matriculated to
mit, so they turned random hall into a dorm to accommodate the extra
students. so in september of 1977 about 80 of us freshmen and about
a dozen upperclassmen moved into random hall. the upperclassmen
were given singles, and were supposed to give us some direction.
but one of the upperclassmen was soon kicked out of the dorm
system for drug possession. so much for their guidance. one good
thing was that on "freshman shower night" before the first 8.01 exam
(is this still a tradition?) there weren't enough upperclassmen
around to throw us freshmen in the showers.

over the next couple years we really bonded with each other in
random hall. we tried to throw parties, but no women ever came.
but when it came to intramural sports we were pretty good despite
our small numbers. i think random hall felt more like a fraternity
than a dorm in those years. all my friends at mit were random hall 
people, and 15 years after graduating, we are still in close touch. 

random hall went co-ed for our senior year, 1980-81. in that
year 14 women moved into the second floor of 282. the women
certainly improved the atmosphere at random hall dramatically.
the following year women moved into one of the floors in 290. 

i spent the summer of 1983 working in cambridge, and ended up
living in random hall again. i shared a lot of random hall stories
with the students who were there that summer. is there still a
clam on the 3rd floor kitchen in 282? a coca-cola bar code?
a dragon in the house lounge? on your homepagelist of randoms
on the web, i noticed that 17 is still the random number and
the molson clipper ship is still part of the random logo. 

in january of 1989 i took my wife (then girlfriend) on a tour
through random hall. it still looked very much the same. the only
difference i noticed was a condom dispenser in the basement. 

i have been back in cambridge for the past two years. i am actually
living in leverett house, one of the harvard undergraduate houses,
where i am a resident tutor in economics. i am also teaching economics
at wellesley college where the students often ask me about my
undergrad days at mit. but i have not yet ventured back into
random hall. perhaps one of these days.

so i will tell all my friends to email you to have their homepages
linked to the random hall page. how about putting our year of
graduation next to our names on the alumni page?

best of luck with your thesis and the remaining coursework.
