hi melissa,
thanks so much for your email... it's wonderful
hearing about random hall after all these year.
would you mind if i forwarded your email to
a bunch of other random alums? 

you are certainly welcome to summarize my random
history on the web, and you are welcome to use my 
name. i was thinking about the molson clipper ship.
we wanted to have a random hall t-shirt, and asked
people to come up with a design. bill gardiner'81
drew a nice enlarged version of the molson clipper
ship. and since it was the only serious submission,
we had a logo. alcohol was not as big an issue on
campus as it is now. until april 1980 the drinking
age in mass was 18. and by april 1980, when it was
raised to 21, most of us in the class of 1981 had
just turned 21. we did buy alcohol for our parties,
but since very few people came, very little alcohol
actually got consumed. our most successful social
event was the annual spring BBQ or picnic. one year
we got everyone down to myles standish state forest
and had a BBQ by college pond. but rather than our
parties, we were probably most proud of our success
on the intramural fields where we consistently
beat out the larger dorms and the jock frats.

our freshman year was the year of the famous blizzard
of february 1978. larger than this winter's blizzard,
MIT shut down classes for four days! we used our 
engineering skills to build a good sized enclosed
igloo on the roof of random hall. i still have a
photo of the igloo. perhaps it should go on the web.

as for floor names, we did not have them when i was
in random hall. the floors certainly had their characters.
4-290 was always threatening to secede from random hall.

anyway, i think random hall is a great place to live.
overall i was unhappy with my undergraduate experience,
but being in random hall and being in boston were two
strong positives. consequently i think the alum page on
the web could be developed into a valuable resource
for random hall students. this is the 15th year reunion
for the first complete class out of random hall, and 
these alums have had time to make some progress in their
careers. i have close friends at JPL, texas instruments,
and kodak. if students need summer jobs or career advice,
i think random alums would be more than happy to talk
to current students in random hall. let me know if
i can help in any way.

congrats on getting your thesis done! and the best
of luck with the rest of your work.

linus
