hi melissa,
thanks for headlining me on the random hall history page.
it looks great. i just wanted to point out a typo...
in 1980-81 women first moved into 2-282, not 4-282.
other than that, just wanted to congratulate you on
graduating from the tute, and wish you all the best
in graduate school. in my personal experience, graduate
school was a lot more fun than mit, to a large extent
because i had learned everything already at mit.
linus
