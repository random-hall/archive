    <h3>History From a Random Alum</h3>
    <p>
      <i>
        Linus Yamane graduated from MIT in 1981. He was part of the first
        freshman class to be housed in Random in 1977. He has sent me some
        interesting history about Random and agreed to allow me to summarize it
        and put it on the web page.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to 1977, Random Hall housed only visiting professors, but in 1977
      too many freshman accepted admission to MIT to be housed in the normal
      dorms. Random became a dorm of about 80 freshman and about 12
      upperclassmen to provide guidance; only male students moved into Random.
      One of these upperclassmen was subsequently kicked out of the dormitory
      system for drug possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The students in Random became very close, but they had trouble attracting
      other people to Random, especially women. : ) At the time Random was also
      renowned in intramural sports, even though there weren't very many Randoms
      to play on the teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random became co-ed for the school year 1980-81. That year, 14 women moved
      into 2-282. "The women certainly improved the atmosphere at Random Hall
      dramatically." : ) [I had to be sure to quote that.] The year after that,
      women moved onto 3-290.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interesting facts about stuff around the dorm: the clam on the Clam Floor
      kitchen wall was there during Linus's residence, as well as the Coca-cola
      bar code on the wall behind the Clam Floor refrigerators. There used to be
      a mural of a dragon in the house lounge, which is not there now, unless
      it's hiding. 17 was the Random number then. And most interestingly, the
      Random ship that is on the wall of the house lounge is the Molson clipper
      ship off the Molson beer can.

    <h3>Randoms in UMOC</h3>
    <p>
      Justin's Year-Old Milk won UMOC in 1995!
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V115/N53/umoc.53n.html">Here's</a>
      what the Tech has to say about it... A Random alum also wrote a
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V115/N54/umoc.54l.html">
        letter to the editor of the Tech
      </a>
      congratulating Justin's UMOC win, and expounding on the proud Random UMOC
      tradition. For example, in 1993,
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V113/N54/umoc.54n.html">
        shabby ran for UMOC
      </a>
      and came in forth. In 1992, then house president
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V112/N51/umoc.51n.html">
        Haider Hamoudi won UMOC
      </a>
      , although this Tech article only covers the beginning of the UMOC
      contest. Random Hall resident Andrew Greene won UMOC in 1988, although
      there doesn't seem to be a Tech article about this.

    <h3>Other Parts of Random's Past</h3>
    <p>
      Well, since I've gone on a Tech-search blitz, you can also check out a lot
      of events in Random's past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most recently, the biggest change at Random has been the new housemasters.
      Our old housemasters (well, as far back as
      <i>I</i>
      know), the Taylors,
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V112/N43/masters.43n.html">
        arrived at Random in September of 1992
      </a>
      . However, their stay was pretty brief. These three articles (
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V115/N4/housemasters.04n.html">#1</a>
      ,
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V115/N23/Tang.23n.html">#2</a>
      ,
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V115/N23/threedorm.23n.html">#3</a>
      ) reported on it. The Taylors leaving wasn't all bad, though, because
      that's how
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V115/N43/newhouse.43n.html">
        we got Nina, Chris, and Simon
      </a>
      , our new housemaster-ing family.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for other outstanding events in Random's past: you can read the article
      about when
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V114/N5/random.05n.html">
        Random voted against spending money on alcohol
      </a>
      . And you can also read how
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V114/N7/random.07n.html">
        Random changed that policy
      </a>
      like a week later to what it is today. As I was looking through the Tech
      archives, I discovered that this big alcohol issue was very similar to the
      past issue at Random about
      <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V109/N14/porn.14n.html">
        developing a policy on pornography
      </a>
      .
