    Random Hall is the smallest dorm on the not-so-far-off north side of the
    <a href="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</a>
    campus. We are situated on a lovely section of Massachusetts Avenue just
    south of Central Square. We are conveniently located right next to a bar---
    I mean, we are close to the Central T stop. : ) There are about 90 of us,
    divided into eight different floors, each with their own separate
    personalities. (Yes, we know the building's only four stories high. : )
    <p>
      Random Hall is a co-ed dorm, with four all-male floors, two all-female
      floors, and two co-ed floors. Each floor is equipped with its own kitchen,
      including refrigerators, stoves, sinks, appliances, and lots of cupboard
      space. A lot of people here choose to cook their own food instead of
      suffering from Aramark. Each floor also has a lounge where much leisure or
      tooling occurs.

      Well, to tell you more about Random (this spiel is usually dragged out
      about the time Rush rolls around), we have a couple key features. We're
      one of the few dorms with a
      <i>legally</i>
      occupiable roofdeck. We also have the cheapest laundry on campus,
      featuring dorm-owned washers and dryers.

    <p>
      Our basement offers other forms of entertainment as well. We have a pool
      table, ping pong table, air hockey table, and foosball. There is also a
      piano room (that actually has a piano), a computer room (with our spiffy
      printer), and a weight room. We also have a beautiful new 27" color TV for
      our main lounge.

      Overall, our rooms are bigger than most other dorms on campus, on a per
      capita basis.
