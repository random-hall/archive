                                As stated in Article VIII, JudComm shall be
                                elected at the first House Meeting in March. The
                                procedure for electing JudComm shall be as
                                follows:
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                1. The chairman of the JudComm shall be elected
                                from all candidates for that position. If no
                                candidate receives the majority votes cast, the
                                candidate with the fewest votes shall be dropped
                                from the ballots and the vote taken again. This
                                process will continue until a candidate receives
                                a majority of the votes cast.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                2. Subsequent to the election of the JudComm
                                Chairman, all unsuccessful candidates for
                                chairmanship are automatically placed in
                                contention for other places in JudComm.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                3. Two members of JudComm from each street
                                address shall be elected from among the
                                candidates from that street address, with only
                                members from that street address eligible to
                                vote. The winners of the election are those two
                                people who received the largest number of votes.
                              </p>

                                candidate for each of the three offices. A vote
                                shall be indicated by an (X) or a (/) next to

                                2. Before tabulation, the total number of
                                ballots cast shall be ascertained.
                              </p>

                                3. Any candidate receiving a plurality of votes
                                cast for an office shall be elected, provided
                                that he/she received at least one-third of the
                                votes cast for that office.

                                of the votes cast for an office, a run-off
                                election shall be held within one week between
                                the two candidates who received the most votes.
                                The candidate who then receives the majority of
                                votes cast shall be elected.
