                                  Random Hall was first opened as an MIT dorm in
                                  1968. It was supposed to be available at the
                                  start of the 1967/68 school year, but there
                                  were construction problems (I seem to remember
                                  some sort of strike that slowed things down)
                                  and it just wasn't finished. Those of us who
                                  had signed up to move to Random were "parked"
                                  elsewhere for the fall semester of 1967. Many
                                  of us shared apartments in Eastgate, which had
                                  just opened. Others were in a building on West
                                  Street. Unlike the later reopening which seems
                                  to have mostly freshman for residents, we had
                                  a fairly normal mix of people from the
                                  then-current classes. There was a lot of
                                  crowding in the existing dorms at the time,
                                  and many of us were quite willing to take
                                  space in a new dorm to keep from being doubled
                                  in rooms designed for one person in the
                                  current dorms. Also, the kitchens and living
                                  rooms on each floor were unique in the dorm
                                  system at the time.
                                </p>

                                  Random actually opened at the beginning of the
                                  spring semester in 1968. The building was
                                  dedicated on February 29, 1968. We had our
                                  one-halfth birthday party on March 1, 1970. We
                                  planned to call it Random House, but the
                                  publishing company of that name threatened to
                                  sue so we settled for "Random Hall". The
                                  official sweatshirts had the definition of the
                                  word "random" taken (I believe) from the
                                  Random House dictionary. The first floor of
                                  290 held Russian House.
                                </p>

                                  Before MIT converted it to a dorm, the
                                  building had been a rooming house. In the
                                  past, it apparently had a few tenants who were
                                  destined to become famous. At the dedication
                                  party, Louis Smullin (then head of the EE
                                  department if I remember correctly) said that
                                  he had lived in the building while he was a
                                  student, and I believe he said Claude Shannon
                                  had lived there as well.
