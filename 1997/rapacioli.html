                                in all the histories I've ever read about Random
                                Hall, one fact always seems to be missing. In
                                1987, one "Dr Pepper", disguised as
                                mild-mannered Random Hall resident Mark
                                Rapacioli (me), won Ugliest Man On Campus. My
                                picture, along with about $80 worth of empty Dr
                                Pepper cans, appeared in the Tech. I tried to
                                locate it on the Tech's web site, but they are
                                missing all the issues from that year. I can't
                                remember how much I raised, but it was to
                                benefit some Boy Scout scholarship or something
                                like that. Maybe some APO member from that time,
                                like Lori Andersen (nee Aronson), can verify
                                this information.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Another little-known fact: sometime in '86 or
                                '87, Random Hall made Nelson and Winnie Mandela
                                honorary dormitory residents. Again, this
                                appeared in the Tech as a letter to the editor
                                from Andy MacDonald '88.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Also in '86 or '87, some dorm residents tried to
                                eliminate the house tutors. That met with a lot
                                of resistance from the "silent majority" (people
                                who never attend house meetings) and from the
                                administration. The "Dump the Tutors" attempt
                                was quickly put to rest.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                About a year later, there was also a "Dump the
                                Ship" movement, by residents who wanted a new
                                official logo. Stalwart traditionalists, joined
                                by die-hard Molson drinkers, wanted to keep the
                                blue ship. Maverick, well-rounded underclassmen
                                wanted a new-wave logo. As I remember, the votes
                                kept coming out tied, we held a couple of noisy
                                (and quite humorous) caucuses, and eventually
                                the tie was broken when a latecomer arrived --
                                and voted to keep the ship.
                              </p>

                                One of the happiest moments in dorm history came
                                with the reappearance of Random Hall D-League
                                Ice Hockey in '86. After a few years without a
                                team, we managed to put together a rag-tag bunch
                                of non-skaters. It only took a few games to win
                                one -- an 11-0 drubbing against a team from
                                Burton-Connor (Connor 4, I believe). Tim
                                "Gretzky" Steele scored four goals in that
                                memorable game, while Amy Chu started an
                                impressive intramural medical history by
                                spraining her knee.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The strangest moment while I was there was when
                                a freshman (I can't remember her name) couldn't
                                get into the dorm she chose. Over the next two
                                days, she got put into limbo, got housed
                                temporarily in Random, got placed in Random
                                permanently, then got cold feet and withdrew
                                from school.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Without a doubt, the saddest moment in the time
                                I lived at Random was the passing of one of our
                                residents, John Bucsela, in '83 or '84. I did
                                not know him very well, but I had met him a
                                couple of times. I believe he had some sort of
                                congenital heart defect. People like Jon Singer,
                                Bill Hoston, or Mike Jones should know more
                                about it.
