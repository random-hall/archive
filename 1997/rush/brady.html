      Perhaps the most important part of Random is that we're a family. Now that
      means a lot of different things to different people, so let us qualify
      that. Random is a very open and trusting place. Most residents leave their
      doors open even when they're not in their room. Residents usually eat
      together in the kitchens and sometimes even cook real food together.
      Residents hang out together, and we genuinely care about each other.

      If you've had a bad day, it is almost certain that someone will notice and
      ask. If you just figured out something really cool, there are tons of
      people around who'd love to listen. People here are just really close and
      take care of each other by working and playing together.

      It's really about trust and caring. And isn't that what a family is all
      about?
