    <h1>The Caffeine Dimension</h1>

    Like it or not, we are all at MIT for one primary purpose:
    <b>to work our butts off.</b>
    <p>
      Whether it is a Master's thesis in electrical engineering, a weekend paper
      in Economics, or a take-home project in basketweaving, at some point every
      night we all need to stop
      <a href="faq.html#def">punting</a>
      and get to work. Caffeine is our friend as we struggle long nights trying
      to figure out exactly what that upside-down triangle is doing to the
      magnetic field equation anyway.
    </p>

      At Random,
      <a href="faq.html#def">tooling</a>
      is often a group activity. Many times I will go into one of the many
      kitchens to find a dozen people all camped out working on their own
      problem sets. Often, people taking the same class will work together. This
      isn't cheating but actually collaboration. Rather than just copy someone
      else's answer, people will draw equations and vector fields and turtles
      and lots of other things on blackboards and have heated arguments that
      will often draw in people who've been working on similar problems for
      years. The most interesting time is when two frosh begin with an argument
      about how to solve an introductory mechanics problem and two grad students
      start arguing about who is right.
    </p>

    <p>
      While MIT's workload can be a real pain sometimes, there are always people
      around who are taking the same class, who have taken that class before or
      who just think they can figure it out and who are willing to take the time
      to talk to you about it. It is a really nice environment. Rather than cite
      statistics about Random's average GPA and how many class bibles we have in
      our library to cheat out of, it is important to understand that people at
      Random really do learn collaboratively.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, people will often find the kitchens distracting. The
      truth is, it's a heck of a lot of fun to be tooling in a kitchen with a
      dozen of your friends and often more fun to just sit around talking to
      them whilst pretending to tool. That is when Random Hall's dual nature is
      really nice. On the one hand, Random's family atmosphere makes it really
      easy to work alongside people. On the other, people will respect your
      privacy so that if you need to retreat into your room and just sit down
      and get cracking, people will give you the space you need. Random is a
      really cool place that way.
