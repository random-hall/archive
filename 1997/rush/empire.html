    <h1>The Empire State Building Dimension</h1>

    <p>
      Random is a building. As such, it has a number of floors. Random is also
      divided into two halves: the 282-side (located at 282 Mass Ave) and the
      290-side (located at 290 Mass Ave). Conveniently, these two halves are
      directly adjacent. Further, on the 1st and 3rd floors, you can even get
      across, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each half of the dorm has 4 floors, and they share a basement and a
      roofdeck. Each level of each half is considered a separate floor and each
      floor has its own name and distinct personality.

    <h2>1-290</h2>
    <i>All-male floor</i>
    <br />
    This floor is smaller than the other floors, since a full half of it is
    taken by the apartment of our Housemaster, Nina. Further, a quarter of it is
    taken by our main lounge, with the front desk, a kitchen for study breaks,
    and the Holy Television.

    <h2>1-282</h2>
    <i>All-male floor</i>
    <br />
    The first floor is one of three all male floors in Random Hall. Famous for
    their coffee and Dunkin Donut study breaks, they are sometimes referred to
    as "Donut Floor." They are proud to house "The Youngest Student at MIT," and
    you may even be able to visit with him during Rush, if his busy schedule
    permits. They also have two truly wonderful tutors, Brian and Jen, living
    with them. One of the more tranquil floors in Random, (possibly because we
    have the most randomly arranged floor plan in the building,) Donut floor
    will have several openings this fall, so be sure to meet with them during
    R/O!

    <h2>2-282:Loop Floor</h2>
    <i>All-female floor</i>
    <br />

    <h2>2-290:Suck Floor</h2>
    <i>Co-ed floor</i>
    <br />
    This floor isn't so named because of a plethora of vacuum cleaners, but
    because Dungeons and Dragons has secured a strong foothold on this floor and
    it never seems to stop. The nickname is a result of some vocal residents'
    dislike of the game and the ability of D&D to suck your time away.
    <p>
      This year, another definition will be added, as the LSC director,
      Refreshments director, one Refreshments subdirector, and one Projection
      subdirector live on Suck. Real World, anyone?
    </p>

    <h2>3-282:Clam Floor</h2>
    <i>All-male floor</i>
    <br />
    Clam Floor is one of the more social floors, and with the television in its
    lounge all last year, Clam Floor was a major locus for activity. It was on
    Clam Floor that the Random Hall Interdependency diagram was created (a graph
    with nodes for residents and arcs to anyone they had ever dated). Clam Floor
    now boasts a manhole to nowhere, and also has the Clam Floor Physics
    Chalkboard. Clams are a wacky and crazy bunch, but are generally pretty cool
    people (Aidan's a Clam, which is why this section is so large).
    <p>
      Clam Floor and Pecker Floor have a long standing grudge, which
      occasionally flares up into a full waterfight that often comes, strangely
      enough, when work levels are at their highest.
    </p>

    <h2>3-290:BMF Floor</h2>
    <i>All-female floor</i>
    <br />
    One of two all-female floors at Random, 3-290 is well known for their
    fresh-baked study breaks. It's a really friendly floor where there's always
    someone in the kitchen, either working or just gabbing away. We're a silly
    bunch, often breaking out into the Toys R Us theme song at 3AM. Stop by
    during rush! They'd love to meet ya!

    <h2>4-282:Bonfire Floor</h2>
    <i>Co-ed floor</i>
    <br />

    <h2>4-290:Pecker Floor</h2>
    <i>All-male floor</i>
    <br />
    Pecker floor, whose name is inspired by the huge "WoodPecker Home
    Furnishing" sign hanging on the north side of the floor, is one of the more
    laid-back and friendly floors you'll find at Random. It is home to the
    famous Pecker floor soda fridge, which occasionally stocks other goodies as
    well, when everyone is feeling suitiably unhosed to make a soda run. The
    floor is currently home to a large TV and stereo, which is used for the
    always popular "Midnight Movie" on Saturday nights, as well as a lot of
    informal socializing.
    <p>
      Peckers and Clams don't get along too well. They occasionally have turf
      wars which result in a lot of people getting wet, and borders don't change
      much, since they don't have any common borders to fight over.
    </p>

    <h2>Roofdeck</h2>
    The roofdeck is one of the most amazing parts of Random. One of the few
    legally accesible roofs at MIT, our roofdeck is equipped with a beautiful
    view of Cambridge, especially at sunset. People grow plants on the roofdeck,
    and over rush we show movies up there. Clam Floor had a BBQ and we played
    freeze tag (the deck is made of nice wood, but it's a bit hard on the knees
    when you dive between someone's legs to unfreeze them) and flew a kite high
    above Mass Ave.
    <p>
      Mostly the roofdeck is just a wonderful place to go and think. I've spent
      dozens of nights sitting up there, looking out over the lights of
      Cambridge, feeling the wind blow past me, looking up at the clouds and the
      stars and thinking about life. Even if you only spend five minutes at
      Random over rush, you must see the roofdeck, if just to know that it's a
      reason to visit your Randomite friends over the term...
