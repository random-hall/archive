      What a silly name! Where does it come from?
    </h2>

    Does it matter? I've lived here for four years and I have never found out.
    There are so many more interesting things to do here.

      Where IS Random Hall anyways?

    <h4>A more useful definition:</h4>
    Random Hall is located at 290 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge MA 02139. This
    means it is on the same street as the main entrance of MIT and the student
    center. If you stand at the entrance of MIT, cross the street, turn right so
    that the entrance is to your right and the student center to your left, go
    straight down the street. Random Hall will be on your left, right after the
    Best gas station. The walk is about five minutes.

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="pain"></a>
      Isn't it a pain living all the way off campus?
    </h2>

    If by pain, you mean the feeling you get from knowing that you don't have to
    walk through that wind tunnel otherwise known as Amherst Alley in the dead
    of winter, then yes, it is. However, let me also mention that Random is
    <i>closer</i>
    to main campus than many other dorms. Being off campus also means that we're
    closer to the best restaurants in Cambridge and just next door to a brand
    new fully-stocked supermarket!

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="cent"></a>
      Who wants to live near Central Square?
    </h2>

    I do I do! Central Square is home to many wonderful things! First and
    foremost, there's a subway station conveniently located. Then there's all
    the bus lines that go through Central Square. It has many different types of
    restaurants, from really cheap to the kind you'd take your parents to
    (assuming they pay). There's also your choice of supermarkets, dry cleaners,
    a coffee shop, a post office with longer hours than the MIT branch, three
    different banks, and at least 3 convenient florists! How can you go wrong?

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="hp"></a>
      Isn't the
      <a href="http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/">Random Hall Home Page</a>
      a little drab?
    </h2>

    Why yes, we think so too. As a matter in fact, it is the official opinion of
    the Random Hall rush chairs that the dorm page is DRAB. Feel free to tell
    our
    <a href="mailto:random-web@mit.edu">webmaster</a>
    that you think so too!

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="munch"></a>
      What is Munchie's?
    </h2>

    It's 4AM. Your paper is halfway done. You're falling asleep. You head
    towards the fridge only to realize that you're completely out of Coke. You
    also happen to be out of quarters and singles, so you can't use the soda
    machine downstairs. ARRRRRRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!!
    <p>
      Don't panic. The obvious solution is to go next door to Munchie's, the
      24/7 convenient store that's 20 steps away. (I've counted!) It is also the
      solution when you're out of orange juice, eggs, or milk, or if you want a
      snack without having to work for it.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="age"></a>
      How old is Random?
    </h2>

    Random Hall is the youngest dorm on campus. It wins this distinction by
    being founded on February 29, 1968, making it currently slightly over 7
    years old.

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="art"></a>
      Who is J. Arthur?
    </h2>

    J. Arthur Random is the resident in apartment #17. Don't bother trying to
    find the room because you won't find it. Unlike all the other rooms at
    Random which are numbered in order, J. Arthur's room will only be found by
    those who are truly of chaotic mind and body. I hope you don't find it,
    because if you do, we won't be able to find you.

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="ork"></a>
      Can you tell me all the secrets of ORK?
    </h2>

    ORK is an acronym for the Order of the Random Knights. According to
    HowToGamit, "ORK is a small tightly knit
    <a href="def">hacking</a>
    group based in Random Hall." As to secrets, well, if I told you, then I'd
    have to give you a noogie, and cybernoogies aren't much of a threat, so when
    you come and visit during rush, we'll answer your ORK questions.

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="nerd"></a>
      Is everyone at MIT a nerd?
    </h2>

    Didn't anyone tell you it was a prerequisite for admission?
    <p>
      But seriously, MIT students are proud of being nerds. To us, a nerd is
      someone who, when seeing an equation on a t-shirt, immediately picks out
      the errors. It's not something you can help. MIT sorta does it to you. But
      don't worry. You'll fit right in.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="date"></a>
      Do people at MIT ever go on dates?
    </h2>

    If, by dates, you are referring to the Carbon-14 type, then yes. If you are
    referring to movie and a dinner, then yes. If you are referring to doing
    homework together, then yes. If you are referring to walks in the moonlight
    by the river, then yes. If you're referring to dancing and partying, then
    yes. If you're referring to walking on date trees, then no.

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="work"></a>
      I plan to work at MIT. What will they pay me?
    </h2>

    Minimum wage at MIT is currently $6.75 an hour. However, some jobs pay
    considerably more.

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="def"></a>
      What are punting, tooling, hacking, and Athena usernames?
    </h2>

    <i>punting</i>
    - the act of putting off work while doing something else.
    <br />

    <i>tooling</i>
    - the act of doing school related work.
    <br />

    <i>hacking</i>
    - the act of climbing through undiscovered tunnels and on roofs. (ie.
    everywhere you're not supposed to be)
    <br />

    <i>Athena usernames</i>
    - Athena is the computing environment at MIT. A username is the account in
    which all your files are kept. Some people are referred to by their
    usernames.

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <a name="fp"></a>
      What are the answers to the first 8.01 exam?
    </h2>

    As I remember, the first question on the exam was:
    <br />
    <center>Write your name here___________________</center>
    Unfortunately, that's all I remember.

    <hr />
