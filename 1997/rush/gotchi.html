    <h1>The Tamagotchi Dimension</h1>

    <p>
      Have you seen the Tamagotchi yet? They're these little weird toys,
      basically an LCD screen to see a little creature who you press buttons to
      feed, spank, or play with. If you treat your little electronic creature
      well, it'll be happy. If you don't, it'll die. It's one of the most
      bizarre toys I've ever seen.

      In the same way, there are some really bizarre people at Random. Cool, but
      weird. People dye their hair purple and others shave their heads. Someone
      shaved off one eyebrow and half of his moustache, and then confused
      everyone by drawing it back in with pen and shaving off the others, making
      it look like his hair had moved over. We've installed a manhole in the
      floor, and we've got our laundry machines hooked up to the web. There are
      some really weird people around here, but weird in a good way.

    <p>Maybe interesting is a good word....</p>

    <p>Hmm. No. Weird is definitely the right word.</p>
