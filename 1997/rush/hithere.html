        him inquisitively, wondering wether they should help this strange, red,
        runt of a man who'd lept into their midst. But silverfish have no

      Hi there and welcome to the Random Hall rush page. This site is designed
      with the intention of giving incoming students an idea of what Random Hall
      is and who we are. "What is Random Hall?" you might ask. A better
      question, however, is "Who are you?" Random is a building, and although we
      love it dearly and call it home, it is not what living at Random is all
      about. Living here is about learning things and making choices. It's about
      friends and family(but almost nobody has MCI). It's group trips to IHOP at
      three in the morning and cooking for study breaks. It's about being an
      individual and being free to do what you want. At Random, we do our own
      thing. Come join us if you want.
    </p>

      Anyway, please feel free to wander around. Raise your hand and ask J.
      Arthur if you have any questions. He'll be more then happy to answer them.
      If you like what you see, come visit us over rush. We'd love to give you
      free food.
