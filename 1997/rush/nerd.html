    <h1>The Nerd Dimension</h1>

    Ah, to be a nerd. Being a nerd isn't about wearing glasses, though lots of
    us do. It's not about talking solely in numbers and
    <a href="faq.html#def">Athena usernames</a>
    and formulae, though lots of us do. It's not even about pocket protectors
    and slide rules, which only the Truly Nerdly among us have. It's an
    attitude. It's being really excited by learning something new and having a
    sense of humor about it.
    <p>
      Nerd pride is filling a kitchen with people playing out the game between
      Deep Blue and Kasparov, trying to guess the next move and trying to find a
      better strategy than either of them. Nerd pride is the Clam Floor
      Chalkboard for the Advancement of Physics and Theoretical Math (or
      Theoretical Physics and Math, if you ask Pramod), and proposing stupid
      puzzles about geometry and sardines and Elmo.

        For example:
        <br />
        In a 4-D cube with three blocks to an edge and periodic boundary
        conditions, what is the maximum number of blocks which can be painted
        without three neighboring blocks being painted? (Neighboring includes
        diagonals.)
        <p></p>

      Nerd pride is playing Nerd Scrabble, where typical words might be "EISA",
      "NANO", "PEROXIDE", or "TAUON". Nerd Pride is trying to build the coolest
      setup you can out of two working speakers, four dead ones, a TV that
      mostly works, and about half a mile of electrical cable. It's about
      installing a manhole cover in the floor, just because it's cool. It's
      about spending dozens of hours building a really cool webpage that no one
      will ever see since you don't have any pornography on it and you don't
      sell anything there. It's about being at MIT and having a sense of humor
      about it.

      To some, everyone at MIT is a nerd. But being a nerd isn't the classical
      definition you might think of. Nerds can be athletic, sexy, well-spoken,
      and not all of them stink from three weeks of shower-fasting. Nerds can be
      really cool people. Hey, if you got into MIT, you're probably a nerd. :)
    </p>

    <p>
      And before you immediately turn tail and get as far away from this place
      as possible, remember:
      <i>it's cool to be a nerd.</i>
      So until the day that our High Nerd Gerry Sussman leads us down Mass Ave
      all the way to the gates of Hahvard in a Nerd Pride march, hold your head
      up high, wear your Nerd Pride pin with pride, and if anyone calls you a
      nerd, laugh. Because it's fun to be a nerd.
