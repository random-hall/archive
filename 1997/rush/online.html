  God, we're nerdy. But being a nerd is about playing with cool toys, poking fun
  at yourself, and generally laughing a lot. So go ahead... play around with
  some fun stuff.... Enjoy!

      YES.... The Glory That Is Quake lives well at MIT, though games get less
      frequent as term goes on. At least for the people who want to pass. But
      anyway, if you've got Quake (registered version required) running on your
      machine, then download Random itself. I'm sure you'll know Aidan's room
      when you find it....
      <p>
        Third drop: Have a full floor now, patterned on Clam Floor. Textures
        still need to be done, more furniture, some lights need to be adjusted,
        still need stairs and doors. But getting there.

        Usage: Copy
        <a href="quake/random7.bsp">random7.bsp</a>
        into c:\quake\id1\maps (or the equiv) and then run "quake +map random7".

  <h2>Shafting</h2>
  Do you want to get shafted on the roof?
  <a href="">Come</a>
  on in.... (18+ only)

    Sorry, boys and girls, there's nothing I can describe about this in mixed
    company that wouldn't be illegal. But come on in when you're old enough...

  <h2>Laundry</h2>
  When you go to school, one of the few responsibiltiies you have is to wash
  your clothes every few weeks. There are some people at MIT who don't seem to
  learn this, and consequently gasmask sales have been pretty good in the
  student center. Don't be one of the offenders. Besides, we have the first
