    <h1>The Party Dimension</h1>

      MIT isn't completely about working and avoiding working. Occasionally we
      actually
      <i>plan</i>
      to spend time relaxing, often in large groups. There are a number of ways
      that said relaxation can be accomplished and a few are detailed here.

    <h2>Dorm Parties</h2>

    The most visible relaxation occurs at dorm parties, when the main lounge
    turns into a strobe-flashing dance club, with music blasting, munchies
    crunching, and people generally enjoying themselves. These parties usually
    have a theme, whether it's the "Irish Spring" party, or the
    "Luke-is-in-a-cage" party or even the famed
    "Burn-down-the-world-cause-it's-the-year-2000" party which is scheduled for
    the near future.

    <h2>Semi-formals</h2>
    Though Andrew attended our first semi formal with his left half dressed in a
    t-shirt and jeans and his right half in a tux, that's not really the idea.
    Last year we took over a floor of the student center on main campus, and
    then Randoms walked down Mass Ave wearing dresses, blazers, and tuxes, (most
    people were only wearing one of these, but not everyone) and slipping all
    over the place. (The first one was an icy night in the winter, and dress
    shoes aren't noted for their traction) From the power tango during Star
    Wars' Imperial March to the bouncing fun of Bumblebee Tuna to the vicious
    battle during Mortal Kombat, a good time was had by all.

    <h2>3am trips to IHOP</h2>

    In Boston's Kenmore Square, there's an International House of Pancakes
    that's open all night (well, not 4 to 6 am, but who wants food at 5am?
    besides the half of MIT that's still awake, that is...). In various other,
    slightly harder to get to, places, there are even nicer IHOPs. A popular
    activity is to wait until you and all your friends are really hosed with
    work, then grab them and anyone else who's still awake and drag them all for
    a good walk across the Harvard Bridge and get some pigs in blankets. Always
    a good way to deal with those hard-to-solve problems. Just put some butter
    and strawberry syrup on that problem set and it goes down much easier.

    <h2>Hockey Games</h2>

    Random has a dozen intramural sports teams, but the most fun has got to be
    our D-league hockey team. D-League is intended for people who can sort of
    skate. As long as you can put on skates, lace them up, and at least get onto
    the ice, you're qualified for D-league hockey. However, since we seem to be
    the only team that doesn't recruit people from the hockey team to play as
    ringers on our team, we rarely win. But it's always a heck of a lot of fun,
    especially if you've never played hockey before. Where else can you go out
    with four of your friends and fall down a lot? Well, maybe wandering around
    LA during their daily earthquakes, but where else?

    <h2>Dorm Trips</h2>

    Periodically throughout the year, we'll organize trips, whether to hike
    through the newly-turned leaves, or go and see a musical in Boston, or to go
    bowling. The best was last winter, when on a snow day Brian Lantz, one of
    our graduate tutors, took a bunch of people sledding on sleds, cafeteria
    trays, or anything else even vaguely slippery.
