                  Random Hall was dedicated in 1968 on Leap Year's Day, and is
                  now one of two undergraduate dorms on the northern side of the
                  MIT campus. (Simmons is the other one.) Our location near
                  Central Square makes shopping and traveling through the entire
                  Cambridge-Boston area extremely convenient. The MBTA Red Line
                  and local H-mart are just a few blocks away, and Star Market,
                  open daily until midnight, is right behind us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Random is divided into eight "floors," each taking up half of
                  a physical floor of the dorm. Think two stacks of four donuts
                  each--that'll give you the right mental picture. Each floor
                  houses between 3 and 14 residents, has a complete kitchen with
                  stove, microwave, dishwasher, and up to four refrigerators,
                  and also has two private
                  <a href="http://bathroom.mit.edu">bathrooms</a>
                  and a lounge. Four of the floors are co-ed, two are
                  all-female, and the other two are designated as all-male
                  floors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the basement one can find a computer room, a workshop, a
                  darkroom, a trunk room, Random's MITnet printer, a music
                  practice room, an EE Lab, a weight room, a game area with a
                  punching bag and pool table, and the Alice in Wonderland
                  Theater. Our three washers and four dryers, which residents
                  can all use for free, are also located in the basement; their
                  <a href="http://laundry.mit.edu">status</a>
                  can be checked online. The first floor features a large lounge
                  where weekly study-breaks are held, as well as a 25-inch Sony
                  stereo television.

                  Our front desk sorts mail, runs soda fridge, lends

                    movies

                  , checks out shop keys, and provides sewing machines and/or
                  vacuums to the hole-y and dust-ridden. On our roof we also
                  have a wooden roofdeck with tables, chairs, and a grill --
                  perfect for picnics, meteor-gazing, movie-watching,
                  boffer-fighting, or even tooling.
