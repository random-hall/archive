                          Bonfire is the top floor in Random Hall. Their parties
                          are the classiest, their floor dinners have made
                          lesser cooks weep in jealousy, and their study breaks
                          are the stuff of legend.

                        <p>
                          At any given time Bonfire might be a silent place of
                          study or a party full of people from all corners of
                          campus. In the morning, you may hear anything from
                          Classical Music to Screamo. If you come back later in
                          the morning, you might hear Bonfaari in their grave
                          discussions of current events, life’s deepest
                          mysteries, and problem sets. Late into the morning, as
                          the moon hangs over Random Hall, ICEy sCREAMs can be
                          heard from the mysterious hooded figures who gather in
                          the lounge, whispering strange secrets to unknown gods
                          as they munch on the night's snack–rifices.

                          Pecker is a cabal of nerdy, ham-fisted theorists.
                          Pecker residents obsess over contract bridge
                          conventions, host both graduate and undergraduate

                          Pecker is also known for housing The Milk, best

                          probably older than at least half the dorm.) We have a

                          one glorious semester, a costume closet. In the

                          Due to its strategic location at the only useful hole
                          in Random's firewall and its population of
                          technophiles, Clam acts as Random's social and
                          entertainment nexus. Clam Floor's residents are an
                          eclectic mix of engineers, mathematicians, and
                          scientists, with interests ranging from video games to
                          sports to group cooking. Clam is also home to the
                          central development center of n-games, the Institute
                          of Troll Studies, and one of the world's largest board
                          game and video game console stockpiles.

                        <p>
                          Once every few months, Clam hosts Clopen Mic Night,
                          with such titillating acts as "taylors demonstrating
                          the sending an email" and "someone doing a dramatic

                          Feynman/Feynman, for those of you more used to the
                          usual notation). Occasionally Clam also torments our
                          Area Director and the Random Hall GRTs by recruiting
                          them to play Four Swords, a Legend of Zelda derivative
                          game that results in much crushing, cursing, and
                          all-around entertainment for all.

                          We do a lot of cooking—whether we’re learning how to

                          break) things, and watch movies. We spend a lot of
                          time in the kitchen together, listening to all types
                          of music, psetting, and cooking food. And, like most

                          lovably standoffish. In our kitchen, which studies

                          Black Hole is a group of guys and girls obsessed with
                          all things nerdly: tabletop roleplaying, building
                          electronics, building nifty things with wood and
                          whatever materials we find at hand, beating video
                          games utterly, cooking, coding, sewing (lots of
                          medieval garb), writing new nerd jokes, painting,
                          beating each other up with padded sticks, watching
                          anime, and even tooling once in a while. While we all
                          have very eclectic interests, the people of Black Hole
                          share a very strong sense of community, which includes
                          the official floor residents, friends who spend time
                          on our floor, and significant others of residents.
                          Most of us spend our time at home (read: Black Hole)
                          nerding, tooling, or procrastinating with the best
                          into the wee hours of morning (or occasionally
                          afternoon). If you enter Black Hole, prepare to be
                          disturbed, perturbed, amused...and perhaps even stuck
                          here forever with no escape.

                          On the up side, we have
                          <i>two</i>
                          52" HDTVs, thousands of watts of audio power, two
                          media servers, and the highest refrigerator to
                          resident ratio. We have plenty of involvement in dorm
                          politics and proudly host our semi-annual movie night
                          amongst a myriad of other events.

                            We also like Taylor Swift, and worship her on our

                          Unlike the typical 14-student floor, Foo is home to
                          only three undergrads. Because of this, the culture of
                          the floor is extremely volatile. Foo has recently
                          gained independence from Destiny and now consists
                          mostly of Dalton, who occasionally deigns to play DM
                          for a bunch of nooblings, Xhi Dae, who looks like his
                          hair caught fire recently, and Clint, who occasionally
                          leaves his room to make old man jokes and chase kids
                          off his lawn.

                        <p>
                          Recently, Foo got a new set of couches that, while not
                          very comfortable to sit on, are great for jumping on
                          and still need to be broken in. The rest of the dorm
                          also likes to abuse our kitchen because many dorm-wide
                          food events take place in the main lounge -- but if
                          you leave dirty dishes in the sink, we will find you
                          and kill you. Or maybe just publicly ridicule you.
