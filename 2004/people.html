                <h3>Friendly Neighbors</h3>
                <p>
                  Random Hall is filled with friendly upperclassmen (and, we
                  hope, friendly freshmen too), who are good not only for
                  hanging out but also for getting academic help and general
                  advice. Randomites are more than happy to help with
                  understanding problem sets, studying for tests, and just
                  figuring out how things work. Because we have a variety of
                  majors and interests, there's almost always someone able to
                  help. Our expertise, however, do not start and end in the
                  realm of academics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Randomites form a tight community and are always there for one
                  another. You can be sure to find someone to help you adjust to
                  college life, deal with academic pressure, handle problems
                  back at home, etc.
                </p>
                <h3>GRTs</h3>
                Random's three friendly Graduate Resident Tutors are neither
                academic tutors (though they, like our other residents, will
                usually help with academics if asked) nor rule-enforcers. They
                do add sanity and something resembling an adult presence to the
                floors. Often seen as "big brothers," (in the friendly sibling
                sense, not the Orwellian sense) they are there to talk to when
                you need it.
                <h3>Heads of House</h3>
                The Heads of House are the dorm's adults; they live with us,
                offer advice and counseling, sponsor dorm events, and are a
                liason to the Deans, MIT Medical, the faculty, and the
                administration.
                <!--Random's Housemaster is Nina Davis-Millis, an MIT librarian. Living with her is her husband Chris, an editor of an art magazine. :( Nina's gone-->
                Random’s Heads of House
                <!--are Laurie and Jared Berezin. Laurie is an ethical jeweler and metalsmith who runs her own company, Beryllina, and Jared teaches full-time in communication-intensive subjects at MIT. Both -->
                care deeply about students' mental and physical health, and
                they’re here to support Randomites during tough times as well as
                share in the happy moments. You can stop by their apartment on
                the first floor anytime to chat about your challenges,
                struggles, and victories at MIT. As the new Heads of House, they
                enter Random this year with excitement, curiosity, and a
                friendly little dog.
                <h3>SocComm</h3>
                SocComm makes life at the Institute a tad bit more fun by
                providing residents with parties, dinners, trips, and other
                miscellaneous fun activities. Whether kickin' it old school on
                the dance floor, driving to New Hampshire to look at the fall
                leaves, or just chillin' in the basement with some food and
                games, SocComm is there to serve!
                <h3>ExecComm</h3>
                Random is ruled by the Executive Committee, lovingly known as
                ExecComm. Most of Random's governing structures have 'Comm' in
                their names because none of us can spell comiteee. ExecComm is
                composed of the 'High Council' and non-voting positions. The
                High Council has a president, vice-president/treasurer,
                secretary, two side-representatives from the 290 side, and two
                side representatives from the 282 side. The non-voting positions
                include SocComm (planning social functions); Video Chair
                (acquiring movies for our library); Rush Chair; Laundry Empress
                (males can be Empresses, too); and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire God
                (watering the plants and take care of the grill on the
                roofdeck).
                <p>
                  Our government is far from oppressive and is very open to
                  input from everyone. Many freshmen are elected to positions in
                  their first term.
                </p>
                <h3>JudComm</h3>
                JudComm is the judiciary branch of our dorm government. Its
                members provide arbitration in disputes and enforce dorm rules
                (of which there are very few). Most dorm problems can be handled
                internally, generally without even involving JudComm.
                <h3>Study Breaks</h3>
                Almost every Thursday of term, the residents of Random gather
                for food and a break from studying. Each floor is responsible
                for organizing one study break a term (the dorm supplies the
                monetary funds). In more recent years our study break themes
                have included:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Freedom -- freedom fries, freedom toast, freedom-roasted
                    coffee, etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>Summer and swimsuits</li>
                  <li>Pi-themed -- "the cake is a pie"</li>
                  <li>
                    The Hypocritical Neovictorian Puritanical High Counsel[sic]
                    of Loop Floor
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Foods taken literally -- ice cream sandwiches with sandwich
                    bread, cakes served from pans, etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>Pumpkin everything</li>
                </ul>
