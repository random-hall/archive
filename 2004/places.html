                <h2><a name="layout">Layout</a></h2>

                The layout of our building is somewhat confusing, so here is a
                three-dimensional view of the floors of the building, linked to
                brief descriptions of each floor. Also marked are places of
                special interest, like our shop, and one instance of each kind
                of room, which are also linked to descriptions.
                <p>

                <h2><a name="rooms">Rooms</a></h2>
                Our rooms are of five types, identified by the last digit of
                their room number. Each type of room has its own quirks and
                personality but every room has, for each occupant, one network
                connection, and an MIT standard desk, chair, bookcase, dresser
                and bed. In addition, rooms are generally personalized by their
                residents to some degree, the redecoration ranging from posters
                on the wall to complete paint jobs and replacement furniture,
                often built by the students.

                <h2><a name="roomtypes">Room Types</a></h2>
                <b>One Rooms</b>
                are singles in the front of the building, facing Mass Ave.
                <br />
                <b>Two Rooms</b>
                are doubles next to the one rooms, also facing out to the
                street.
                <br />
                <b>Three Rooms</b>
                are singles which look out onto the air and light shafts in the
                middle of the building.
                <br />
                <b>Four Rooms</b>
                are singles divided into two halves by arches, and also look out
                on the shafts.
                <br />
                <b>Five Rooms</b>
                are divided doubles with outside windows facing the back of the
                building. Each five room has a large half, typically occupied by
                an upperclassman, and a small half, typically occupied by a
                freshman.
                <br />

                <h2><a name="location">Location</a></h2>
                Aside from the physical facilities of our building, Random has
                some unique features due to its location as well. We are located
                northwest of main campus, on the edge of Central Square. A great
                benefit of this is that we are very close to a large number of
                restaurants, which are, in many cases, cheaper and better
                quality than the on-campus dining options. Added to this is the
                fact that we have plenty of kitchen space and a supermarket just
                around the corner, so many of our residents don't eat on campus
                at all. We are also quite close to the Central Square T stop,
                making us the closest dorm to a T stop of all of the dorms west
                of Mass. Ave.
                <p>
                  The idea of living "off campus" often raises a couple of
                  questions: "Isn't it a long way to walk to campus?" and "Do
                  you feel safe being off campus?". To answer the first
                  question, we are only a five minute walk from Lobby Seven,
                  which is exactly the same distance as Burton Connor, one of
                  the closer of the West Campus dorms. As far as safety is
                  concerned, we have had no problems. The walk from campus to
                  Random is entirely along Mass Ave, a busy, populated street,
                  which can make it a lot safer than walks along smaller roads,
                  such as Memorial Drive and Amherst Alley, routes to the West
                  Campus dorms, after dark.
                </p>
                <hr width="50%" />
                <h2><a name="roofdeck">Roofdeck</a></h2>

                Random is one of three dorms blessed with a roofdeck. We use our
                roofdeck to show movies during rush, for occasional parties and
                barbeques, and as a nice place to hang out.
                <h2><a name="mainlounge">Main Lounge</a></h2>
                Our main lounge, located on Foo Floor, is the venue for most of
                the large gatherings that take place, including parties, dorm
                government meetings, and group homework sessions, to name a few.
                The main lounge also contains a kitchen (behind a bar known, of
                course, as the Foo bar), a TV, and our homebuilt 24-inch
                subwoofer.
                <h2><a name="ee">EE Lab</a></h2>
                Located in the back of our basement is the student-built
                electrical engineering lab. The lab, which is funded by the dorm
                government, has various test equipment, facilities to print
                circuit boards, and a prodigious quantity of supplies.
                <h2><a name="shop">Shop</a></h2>
                Random has a small but well stocked shop in the basement,
                equipped with a table saw, drill press, and scroll saw, along
                with a set of pneumatic tools and an air compressor, plus a
                fairly complete selection of hand tools, powered and otherwise,
                good for just about any fairly small project.
                <h2><a name="laundry">Laundry</a></h2>

                Random's world-renowned laundry room has three washers and four
                dryers, which residents may use for free. More importantly, all
                of the machines are wired to a
                <a href="http://laundry.mit.edu/">server</a>
                which allows us to know via the internet which machines have
                been on, and for how long. Unlike other dorms, we own and
                maintain our own laundry machines, allowing us to choose the
                price of a load of laundry, which we have currently set to free.
                <h2><a name="piano">Music Room/Basement Kitchen</a></h2>
                The kitchen in the basement is rarely used for cooking, but it
                contains an upright piano with a collection of sheet music, and
                our ping-pong table.
                <h2><a name="aiw">Alice in Wonderland Lounge/Theater</a></h2>
                The Alice in Wonderland lounge (so named due to its undulating
                purple and black floor and low ceiling) contains most of our
                recreational facilities: pool table, air hockey table, and
                foosball table. The Alice in Wonderland lounge is also the
                location of our dorm's theater, which has a projector, DVD and
                VHS players and a Bose sound system.
                <h2><a name="weight">Weight Room</a></h2>
                Random's weight room is set up with all kinds of fitness
                equipment: free weights, a weight machine, a treadmill, a mini
                trampoline, and an exercise bike.
                <h2><a name="trunk">Trunk Room</a></h2>
                Random has a large space in the basement dedicated to storage of
                residents' excess posessions, from trunks to computer boxes.
                <h2><a name="desk">Desk</a></h2>

                <p>
                  Random's student-staffed front desk lends movies, vacuum
                  cleaners, and sports equipment to residents. Due to MIT's new
                  security policy it no longer offers security, but continues to
                  maintain the guest list for non-residents who are
                  theoretically allowed into the building without an
                  accompanying resident.
