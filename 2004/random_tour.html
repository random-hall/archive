                          Woops! Looks like you're a bit too early -- none of
                          the desk workers are even up yet! But fret not, for
                          desk services will open promptly on August 25th, 2016
                          at 8:00am, when someone finally manages to prod the
                          first shift worker awake and drag her downstairs to
                          man the keep.

                          ! We love answering questions from anyone wondering
                          what it's like to be a student at MIT or living in
                          Random Hall, whether you're a prospective student,
                          parent, or even a fellow college student just curious
                          to know how the other side lives.

                          You find yourself in the airlock, where you'll need to
                          check in with the Allied Barton worker at desk.

                        <p>
                          Just pop in, say hi to the worker, and maybe mention
                          that you're a prefrosh -- show them your little
                          plastic badge and they should let you in. If you know
                          your way around from here, great! Just head upstairs
                          and go attend whatever event you happen to be here
                          for. Otherwise, turn right through the door with a
                          window, and you'll find yourself in Foo proper.

                          After going through a series of twists and turns, you
                          find yourself standing, in dim light, in front of a
                          long-forgotten door that appears to have been opened
                          recently. It may have been a dark room at one point,
                          but the sign indicates that it now contains grues. But
                          wait! The door's been opened! What happened to the
                          grues then?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          From behind you hear a slithering and increasingly
                          loud, horrible gurgling noises. You turn and try to
                          face it, but discover to your horror that you have
                          nothing with which to fight it off. Your final thought
                          as its slavering fangs engulf you in neverending
                          darkness is that you probably should have taken the
                          tour instead.

                          You enter through the door and find yourself in a
                          large-ish room with rows of ugly green couches. There
                          are artifacts on the mantle above the unlit fireplace,
                          as well as ceiling tiles decorated in various colors
                          and strange markings. The person sitting behind the
                          desk appears to be a desk worker, in charge of mail
                          and soda fridge and vacuums as well as welcoming
                          visitors and pointing them in the right direction. On
                          the couch are also several people who look up when you
                          come in.

                          You take a deep breath and, gripping your bag of free
                          MIT goodies, step up to the front desk. The desk
                          worker smiles, clears some room on the table and gives
                          you their full attention.
                        </p>

                        <p>"Hey there. You need a schedule or something?"</p>

                        <p>
                          You nod. A schedule is probably a good thing to have.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          They peel two sheets of paper off two of the stacks
                          piling up around them, grab a booklet from the pile of
                          booklets in the corner, and hand them to you across
                          the table. One of the two sheets appears to be a
                          comprehensive list of some sort, with strange names
                          and obscure references all over it. The other is a
                          list of events, but it seems to have more 17s and 47s
                          than you're used to.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          As you peruse them, the desk worker asks, "Do you also
                          want a tour?"
                        </p>

                          You make your way over to the ugly green couches in
                          foo and sit down. Two of the three inhabitants, having
                          apparently seen that you mean no harm, return to their
                          conversation on fixing the errant grue population in
                          the basement. One of them seems to think that taking a
                          flamethrower to the problem is a good idea, but the
                          other one wants to maybe take the destruction down a
                          notch or two.
                        </p>

                        You listen to their conversation, but it doesn't seem to
                        yield any important information. You also aren't sure
                        why you're sitting on this couch in the first place. But
                        you've noticed for some time now that the third person
                        on the couch has been staring at you intently. You
                        squirm a bit uncomfortably under their gaze.
                        <p></p>

                        <p>
                          "What?" you finally demand, though it comes out more
                          like a squeak. "Do you need something from me?"
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          "No, but I think you want something from
                          <i>me</i>
                          ." The person grins, a glint of mischief in their
                          eyes. "Hey kid, how would you like a tour of the
                          dorm?"
                        </p>

                          You awkwardly shuffle in place. Two of the three
                          inhabitants of the couch, having apparently seen that
                          you mean no harm, return to some conversation they
                          were having. They seem to arguing very fervently, but
                          you'll need to get closer if you want to hear what
                          they're talking about.

                        <p>
                          The desk worker is now staring at you, somewhat
                          bemused. They also seem to be giving cursory glances
                          between you and the non-arguing inhabitant on the
                          couch,and debating whether they should call you over
                          to hand you some stuff.

                          You make your way over to the ugly green couches and
                          sit down. The two who were arguing seem to have
                          reached a consensus on something -- one suggests
                          grabbing several aerosol cans of air freshener from
                          all the bathrooms before they head down to the
                          basement to finish the deed. The other seems a bit
                          hesitant with this approach but follows along anyways,
                          adding that they should at the very least bring along
                          some very bright lights and two fire extinguishers in
                          case something goes wrong.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          You continue to listen in on their conversation, but
                          it doesn't seem to yield anything important or
                          substantive enough for you to get any context from it.
                          You also aren't sure why you're sitting on this couch
                          in the first place. But you've noticed for some time
                          now that the third person on the couch has been
                          staring at you intently. You squirm a bit
                          uncomfortably under their gaze.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          "What?" you finally demand, though it comes out more
                          like a squeak. "Do you need something from me?"
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          "No, but I think you want something from
                          <i>me</i>
                          ." The person grins, a glint of mischief in their
                          eyes. "Hey kid, how would you like a tour of the
                          dorm?"

                          The person on the couch stands up and extends their
                          right hand towards you. "Great! I'm the tour guide for
                          this next part. My name is [blah], but you can call me
                          J. Arthur." They grab a map off of the table and shove
                          it at you.

                          we usually use this space for dorm-wide events and

                          tour-loving prefrosh than you.

                          the map it seems that it leads to Black Hole. There's
                          also that door in the back, which will take you to
                          Destiny. Alternatively, you can stay on the couch and
                          see if anything else exciting happens to come by.

                          allergies want to live here, and partially because
                          it's not good to have cats in the kitchen, where they
                          can chew on wires and disturb the food and etc."

                          You decide to stick around Foo for a while. There's
                          not much going on here though, so you pass the time
                          counting and staring at all the colorful ceiling
                          tiles.

                        <p>
                          At some point though, the two occupants of the couch
                          from earlier come back, carrying what appear to be two
                          large black trashbags filled to the brim with aerosol
                          cans. Both are now dressed in much more multi-purpose
                          clothing, complete with cargo pants and... rope?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          They catch you staring at them and one of them grins.
                          The other gives the first a wary look.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          "Hey, prefrosh," the first one chirps
                          conversationally, ignoring the other's elbow jabs.
                          "We're going to go do something really fun in the
                          basement right now. Want to come along?"

                          With the map and after much difficulty, you find your
                          way upstairs and into Black Hole kitchen. The kitchen
                          is filled with all kinds of strange paraphernalia,
                          including what appears to be a giant baby seal club
                          and a parrot hanging from the ceiling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Overall, it feels very home-y and idiosyncratic, like
                          some eccentric hoarder was given free rein to decorate
                          the space. The shelves above the fridge seem a bit
                          high, and you're not sure how anyone ever gets
                          anything up there, but...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          All the residents in the kitchen are looking at you
                          expectantly. They seem friendly enough.

                          Somehow, despite the twists and turns you find
                          yourself on Destiny. The lighting on this floor seems
                          a bit odd, and one of the doors in the kitchen seems
                          much newer than the rest, but you figure it's probably
                          just ambience or something, so whatever.

                          You make your way over to the ugly green couches and
                          sit down. They're absurdly bouncy and the fabric is
                          rough -- far more suited for making trampolines than
                          reception and lounge area couches.

                        <p>
                          You pass the time mulling over some of the painted
                          ceiling tiles, but they don't seem to yield anything
                          important or substantive enough for you to get any
                          context from it. You also aren't sure why you're
                          sitting on this couch in the first place. But you've
                          noticed for some time now that the third person on the
                          couch has been staring at you intently. You squirm a
                          bit uncomfortably under their gaze.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          "What?" you finally demand, though it comes out more
                          like a squeak. "Do you need something from me?"
                        </p>

                        <p>

                          <i>me</i>
                          ." The person grins, a glint of mischief in their
                          eyes. "Hey kid, how would you like a tour of the
                          dorm?"

                          You do another awkward shuffle in place. By this point
                          it seems like no one is really paying attention to you
                          -- or rather, the desk worker seems preoccupied with a
                          huge stack of mail that has just spontaneously
                          appeared on their desk, and the person on the couch
                          appears lost in thought.

                        <p>
                          The desk worker gets up and takes the mail bin with
                          them through the door in the back at some point.
                          They've locked up desk before leaving, so there isn't
                          much to do there now. You'll have to wait for them to
                          come back if you need something.

                        <p>
                          The person on the couch is still bored. Maybe you

                          You sit down on the now empty couch. The two
                          upperclassmen head off, the second one telling the
                          first that maybe, if even a prefrosh thinks it's a bad
                          idea, they should just leave the problem be and come
                          back with a different solution later. You hear the
                          first begrudgingly agree, and wonder what it was that
                          you missed out on.

                          The kitchen is quiet as you shuffle into it. The pots
                          and pans are colorful, as if someone couldn't decide
                          whether they wanted the kitchen to be purple or orange
                          or pink. On the walls are dozens of Ryan Gosling "hey
                          girl" memes, each with either an inspirational quote
                          or a silly STEM-related pick-up line.

                          Several of the posters by the sink and refrigerators
                          are in full color, and appear to be dish-washing PSAs.

                          In the lounge are a TARDIS and a beanbag. The TARDIS
                          seems to be locally bound so you can't travel across
                          the universe or even the dorm with it, but the beanbag
                          looks comfortable and there are many books in the
                          bookshelves.

                        <p>
                          There's also a hole in the wall. It probably takes you
                          to some other floor, but maybe you shouldn't go too
                          off track.

                          Through the glass in the door, a cat stares evenly at
                          you. It moves out of your way as you open the door to
                          the lounge, and gives you a backward knowing look as
                          it slinks away into the closet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          You should probably not follow the cat. Who knows how
                          friendly it is, and if you follow it you might end up
                          hurting yourself and getting trapped in the closet,
                          and then no one will know where you are and your
                          parents will be sad and weeks from now you will
                          emerge, more feline than human and probably coughing
                          up hairballs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Just don't do it. It's probably a bad idea. That cat
                          needs its space, man.

                          hope that the cat comes back out.

                          sit down. As you do this, you notice that its other
                          inhabitant has been staring at you intently. Their
                          eyes are a chocolate brown, with clear golden
                          undertones. You squirm a bit uncomfortably under their
                          gaze.

                          The kitchen table is overflowing with computer
                          monitors. Amidst the wires and cables you see a
                          glimpse of strange knick knacks, pens, and
                          miscellaneous scrap paper -- in one corner sits a
                          forlorn box of goldfish snacks. The residents are all
                          intently staring at their monitors.

                          Reflected in the mirror above the mantle is a giant
                          clam, its eyes pointed squarely at you. Feeling a bit
                          uncomfortable with the gaze, you go into the lounge.

                          Here, controllers and game consoles lay tangled in a
                          pile of wires. Games are strewn casually about the
                          room, with a larger stack in the back by the TV and
                          several much smaller collections on tables, couches,
                          near the closet, etc. The chalkboard also includes
                          some amusing scribbles and what appears to be an alien
                          form of score-keeping.

                          newer Cambridge law has outlawed them. Therefore, we
                          aren't allowed to change 50% or more of the deck at
                          once -- if we do, it falls under renovation and then
                          we have to bring it up to code, i.e remove the entire

                          the deck, then we do the other 49% of the deck, then
                          we go back and look over the plans and realize that

                          clothes, cream and white and in some strange,
                          steampunk neo-victorian style, cover their entire body
                          from their neck to their toes, and their face is
                          obscured by a veil. Shimmering slightly, they hand you
                          a vestment of wool. It feels sturdier than it looks,
                          yet light at the same time.

                          front of the structural monkey bars. They give you a

                          basement, of course, but if you want to leave, just
                          head up the stairs and you're good. I'll just be

                          itself. "It might help you more than you would

                          offering up such helpful commentary as "Me and you,
                          kid, we gon' go far with this partnership" and

                          continue through the basement, lost in your thoughts.
                          Hasn't it been a while already since you left your
                          tour guide? Where's the exit, anyways? Why are there
                          so many chairs and tables down here, and cannibalized
                          bits of bed?

                          A low growl and a hissing interrupt your thoughts.
                          From behind you, the Milk leaps up and down
                          erratically.

                          waving angrily in your general direction. "Been here

                          gives you a rattled look, if milk could look rattled.

                          The pink spray clatters along the ground and explodes,
                          releasing a large cloud of pink dust. The grue growls,

                          "Help me!" you scream back at the milk, as the grue
                          advances and prepares to swallow you whole. "You've
                          been nothing but act old and outdated this entire

                          jumps forward with a clanging sound. "Been waitin' on

                          The clamhole cover flies at the grue and squashes it
                          under its massive weight. With a suspicious
                          <i>squick</i>
                          sound, the black mass writhes and retreats beneath the

                          satisfied. "One grue squished, many more to go. You

                          container, but nod in thanks anyways. The Milk gives
                          you a scrutinizing look.

                          is too heavy for one person to carry alone, and you
                          don't have any materials for a lever. The clamhole

                          running out of the lounge, waving several foam sticks.
                          They shove one into your hands. "Take this -- it's too
                          dangerous to go alone." They then rush by and into the

                          newer Cambridge law has outlawed them. Therefore, we
                          aren't allowed to change 50% or more of the deck at
                          once -- if we do, it falls under renovation and then
                          we have to bring it up to code, i.e remove the entire

                          on one of the chalkboards, it was probably a quote
